There are three folders in the /src folder. The /data folder has the files that are used for the app.
The /ImageResizer folder has the source code to make an image square.
The /SpellChecker folder has the source code to spell check a file.

There is a README in each of the source code folders, but in short these files can be tested by invoking
the shell files found in there:
	RunImageResizer.sh
	RunSpellChecker.sh

Screenshots showing the correct output can also be found in the /output folder of this directory
